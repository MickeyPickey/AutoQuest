## 🧭 Overview
**AutoQuest** is a lightweight World of Warcraft 1.12 (Vanilla) addon designed to streamline questing by automating repetitive interactions. It automatically:
- Accepts quests when you talk to NPCs  
- Turns in completed quests instantly  

No more tedious clicking—just pure questing efficiency.

## ✨ Features
- **Auto-Accept Quests:** Instantly accepts available quests from NPCs  
- **Auto-Turn In Quests:** Automatically completes eligible quests  
- **Smart Reward Selection:** If all quest rewards are unusable by the player, the addon selects the one with the highest vendor value  
- **Manual Override:** Hold the **Shift** key to temporarily pause automation and interact manually  
- **Performance-Friendly:** Lightweight and optimized for minimal impact  
- **Vanilla-Compatible:** Fully supports the WoW 1.12 API

- **Slash Commands:** Add `/autoquest` commands for quick toggles and debugging  
- **Flexible Reward Logic:** Option to auto-pick the highest value reward regardless of usability
