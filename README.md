## 🧭 Overview
**AutoQuest** is a lightweight World of Warcraft 1.12 (Vanilla) addon designed to streamline questing by automating repetitive interactions. It automatically:
- Accepts quests when you talk to NPCs  
- Turns in completed quests instantly  
- Selects the best reward based on usability and vendor value  

No more tedious clicking—just pure questing efficiency.  
No more watching someone steal your quest giver while you blink 😑
